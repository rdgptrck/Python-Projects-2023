**Python Projects - 2023**

Welcome to my repository! This repository contains Python programs I created in 2023, when I was in my 12th grade during vacant period.

**About**
These projects were developed to enhance my understanding of Python programming. 
They focus on control structures, logic implementation, and interactive user experiences.

**Projects**
Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Adventure Game** - An interactive text-based game that uses `if-else` statements to navigate different story paths based on user choices.
2. **Quiz Game** - A simple quiz that evaluates user knowledge using `if-else` statements.
Points are awarded for correct answers, and the total score is displayed at the end.
3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** - A game where you play against the computer using a `while` loop and `if-else` statements.
Your score increases each time you win, and the final score is displayed when you quit the game.

**Technologies Used**
- Python Programming Language
- VS Code

**License**
